#### Key Takeaways
- I learned how versatile and powerful HTML and CSS could be when it comes to creating websites even on their own!
- I have also learned the importance of using flexbox, especially when it comes to responsive design and planning for different screen sizes
- Lastly, I have become more thoughtful when it comes to designing; I have integrated the use of Figma in creating my website, and I saw how important it is to be mindful of every component or object that I design for the efficiency and performance of my code
